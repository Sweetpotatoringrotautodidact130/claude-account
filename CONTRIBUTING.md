# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve claude-account.

## Before opening a change

- Search existing issues and pull requests.
- Use a GitHub issue for behavior changes that would alter the command-line
  interface or stored state format.
- Never post Claude credentials, access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, or
  the contents of `.credentials.json`.

## Development setup

Requirements:

- Linux
- Rust 1.85 or newer
- Claude Code only when manually testing real authentication

Run the local checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --locked --all-targets
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The automated tests use temporary directories and a fake Claude executable.
They must not read or modify the developer's real `~/.claude` directory.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused.
- Add or update tests for behavioral changes.
- Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md when the user-facing behavior changes.
- Preserve backward compatibility for `state.json`, or include an explicit
  migration.
- Explain destructive filesystem behavior clearly and test its path guards.
